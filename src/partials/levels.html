          Donut Boom! is designed with a gentle learning curve that welcomes
          beginners while still challenging seasoned puzzle lovers. The game
          currently features over 50 levels (with more added regularly),
          starting with simple layouts and gradually introducing more complex
          mechanics.

            Early levels are designed to teach you the basics—like sorting
            donuts into empty boxes and matching by color. As you advance, the
            puzzles increase in complexity with tighter space, more donut
            colors, and fewer available moves. Mid-tier levels introduce layered
            stacks, decoy donuts, and locked positions that require careful
            sequencing and forward planning. Advanced levels are truly a test of
            strategy, logic, and memory, where one wrong move could force a
            restart. But don't worry—every level is designed to be fair and
            solvable without needing hints or purchases. If you’re a
            perfectionist, you’ll love replaying levels to earn 3-star scores by
            using the fewest moves possible. The difficulty system keeps things
            fresh without overwhelming players. It’s a sweet progression
            journey—from casual sorting to masterful stacking. Plus, seasonal
            bonus levels and special challenge modes are coming soon to keep the
            game exciting and full of surprises!
