              Yes, Donut Boom! is completely free to download and play. The core
              gameplay, including all available levels, can be accessed without
              any cost. We do include optional ads and in-app purchases to
              support the game’s development and future updates. If you choose
              to watch ads or purchase hints or power-ups, it can enhance your
              experience but is never required. You can enjoy a full and
              satisfying puzzle experience even if you never spend a cent. We
              believe games should be fun, fair, and accessible to everyone.

              The goal is to sort colorful donuts into boxes so that each box
              contains donuts of the same color. You tap one box to pick up the
              top donut, then tap another box to drop it—only if the top color
              matches or the box is empty. You win the level when all donuts are
              properly grouped. Early levels help you learn the rules, while
              later levels test your strategy. There are no timers or penalties,
              so you can take your time to plan your moves. It’s relaxing,
              logical, and highly satisfying.

              No, you don’t need a constant internet connection to enjoy Donut
              Boom. Once downloaded, the game can be played entirely offline,
              making it perfect for travel, commuting, or relaxing anywhere
              without Wi-Fi. However, features like ad rewards or cloud save do
              require an internet connection. We designed the core experience to
              be available at all times, regardless of network status. Whether
              you're online or offline, the puzzle fun never stops.

              Donut Boom is currently available for Android devices running
              version 6.0 or later. It’s optimized to run smoothly on both
              phones and tablets, adapting beautifully to different screen
              sizes. We are actively exploring a version for iOS devices, which
              may be released in future updates. If your Android device meets
              the minimum requirements, you’ll get full functionality and a
              seamless experience. For best performance, we recommend keeping
              your device updated to the latest Android version.

              This allows players to focus on strategy and logic without feeling
              rushed. It’s a great game to unwind with after a busy day. Our

              The game starts off easy to help you learn the mechanics, but the
              challenge ramps up gradually. As you progress, you’ll encounter
              more boxes, more colors, and tighter spaces, which require careful
              thinking. Higher levels may introduce limited moves, tricky
              stacking sequences, and obstacles like locked donuts. These
              advanced puzzles are designed to challenge your logic without
              feeling unfair. If you enjoy thinking ahead and solving clever
              problems, you’ll love the later stages of Donut Boom.

              Absolutely! Each level in Donut Boom can be replayed as many times
              as you like. You earn stars based on how efficiently you solve the
              puzzle—fewer moves mean more stars. If you didn’t get three stars
              the first time, you can always go back and try to optimize your
              strategy. This makes the game perfect for completionists and
              perfectionists. Replaying levels also helps reinforce logic and
              discover new approaches to solving puzzles.
